> A React Render Props implentation for <Tabs /> and <Accordion /> for managable code sharing.

Both Tabs and Accordion have the same logic expectations and most of the times for creating this components it would be better to create a shared code for it. I use CRA for react boilerplate for quick experimentation

I also publish a blog post related with this repo, you can check it here. http://thecodingwhale.com/building-tabs-and-accordion-components-along-with-react-render-props/

Thank you!
